# Introduction
Solitary confinement is often criticized as being one of the most cruel punishments utilized by the U.S. Criminal Justice System. In it, individuals are deprived of human contact and, as a result, can develop disorders that prevent them from reintegrating into society. This study sought to establish whether the opposite of that punishment might therefore have the opposite effect. Specifically, it examines the effect of community groups — such as religious or educational groups — on rule violation rates in correctional facilities.

# Methods 
Here, we analyzed the “Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities, 2004” by the Bureau of Justice and Statistics. It includes 14,499 x 3,000 data entries of incarcerated individuals in state facilities. We chose the 2004 version because, unlike others, it included a “Facility ID,” which we controlled for. Note: we used state not federal facilities, as this provided a geographic distribution. We relied on a logistic regression to model correlation between involvement in community groups and rule violations. We also controlled for confounding variables (race, Hispanic, sentence length, sex, age, U.S. born, age at first arrest, marital status, Facility ID).
