## Further Research
This is a surprising finding, but it does raise the question of what kinds of educational groups most contribute to this rise in rule violations amongst incarcerated individuals. 

This could be done by getting the value_counts.get() for each of the following questions and then ammalgamating them to see if there is any that has a significantly higher rate of rule violations and what the implication of that might be. 

Questions:

    V2501 - S10Q11B_1: What kind of program was that - basic classes up to the 9th grade, high school classes
    to get a diploma or GED, college level classes, or English as a second language?

    V2502 - S10Q11B_2: What kind of program was that - basic classes up to the 9th grade, high school classes
    to get a diploma or GED, college level classes, or English as a second language?

    V2503 - S10Q11B_3: What kind of program was that - basic classes up to the 9th grade, high school classes
    to get a diploma or GED, college level classes, or English as a second language?

    V2504 - S10Q11B_4: What kind of program was that - basic classes up to the 9th grade, high school classes
    to get a diploma or GED, college level classes, or English as a second language?

    V2505 - S10Q11B_5: What kind of program was that - basic classes up to the 9th grade, high school classes
    to get a diploma or GED, college level classes, or English as a second language?

## Alternative Hypotheses:
### GED
For GED, one factor which may explain this is that only people who have been in prison for a long time (and are therefore more likely to have been written up for a rule violation) get their GED programs. This might also explain other groups, as those who have been in prison for longer are going to be more likely to join groups eventually, but also more likely to be written up for a violation.
